# Primitives and classes homework

This homework contains two parts, one for primitives and one for classes. The homework text and requirements can be found at each place in which you have to implement the code, written with a 'TODO'
comment. (Please make sure to find all the places where you have to implement the code, either by global searching for the 'TODO' word or by using the IDE's 'TODO' section).

## Run the primitives test

mvn '-Dtest=primitives.**' test

## Run arrays & classes test

mvn '-Dtest=arraysclasses.**' test
